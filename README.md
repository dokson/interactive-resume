## 🖼️ Project Story

I discovered the [original project by Robby Leonardi](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/) (a groundbreaking work that won major web awards like [FWA](https://thefwa.com/), [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/), and [CSS Design Awards](https://www.cssdesignawards.com/), and is widely recognized as one of the first truly gamified resumes) back in **2019** when I was applying for a **Game Lead** position at [Bending Spoons](https://bendingspoons.com/). Since I wanted to stand out by presenting my career in a **game-based format**, I customized it, making the first version of my interactive resume. It paid off: I made it past the initial screening, which is known to be extremely selective, and I was able to proceed with the interview process for the role. I designed my **personal reinterpretation** of the original concepts, updating characters, backgrounds, and the storyline to reflect my skills and journey as a professional.

The project remained untouched until **2025**, when I decided to revisit and polish it. I felt it would be a shame to keep it private, so I published it here on **GitHub Pages** (through the `gh-pages` branch) hoping it could inspire others to reimagine how a resume can look and feel.
