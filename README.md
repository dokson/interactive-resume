## 🖼️ Project Story

I discovered the [original project by Robby Leonardi](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/) (a groundbreaking work that won major web awards like [FWA](https://thefwa.com/), [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/), and [CSS Design Awards](https://www.cssdesignawards.com/), and is widely recognized as one of the first truly gamified resumes) back in **2019** when I was applying for a **Game Lead** position at [Bending Spoons](https://bendingspoons.com/). Since I wanted to stand out by presenting my career in a **game-based format**, I customized it, making the first version of my interactive resume. It paid off: I made it past the initial screening, which is known to be extremely selective, and I was able to proceed with the interview process for the role. I designed my **personal reinterpretation** of the original concepts, updating characters, backgrounds, and the storyline to reflect my skills and journey as a professional.

The project remained untouched until **2025**, when I decided to revisit and polish it. I felt it would be a shame to keep it private, so I published it here on **GitHub Pages** (through the `gh-pages` branch) hoping it could inspire others to reimagine how a resume can look and feel.

## 📝 License

This project is based on code from [Robby Leonardi's interactive resume](http://www.rleonardi.com/interactive-resume/), originally published more than 10 years ago and never formally open-sourced. The codebase has been **extensively refactored and reorganised** following modern software engineering best practices, and the characters, storyline, and most visual assets have been replaced with original work by Alessandro Colace, though some graphic elements from the original site are still present.

Because the underlying code derives from a proprietary work, no open-source license is applied here, and the project is **not available for redistribution or commercial use**.

You are welcome to view the code and draw inspiration for your own interactive resume, but please build something that genuinely reflects your own story and style.
